    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a language designed to specify the overall appearance of webpages as well as the appearance and structure of the text and elements such as images and buttons on webpages and their layout. Styles can be specified with CSS using internal style sheet definitions which are placed right into HTML/XHTML code or in external files.</p>
